# Pytento Documentation

This is the official documentation of Pytento package.

At his version (1.0.0) I did not spend too much time on creating a good documentation because the project is extremly small (under 1000 lines).

So the documentation currently only have two information:
- [download](./download.md)
- [usage](./usage.md)
