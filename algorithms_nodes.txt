algorithms and tests for the project:

### Von Neumann Architecture

Input:
User inputting tests into the framework and checking if it works correctly

Process:
The process evaluates if the tests are asserting correctly

Memory:
The process can use memory such as database access if the system has requested it

Output:
Outputting if tests run correctly or which one breaks

### Nodes

- Test Node
- Test Fixture Node
- Test Suite Node
- Test Runner Node

### Algorithms

Input Algos:
- user is going input their test cases

Process Algos:
- first a test runner is started
- test runner checks if all of the tests are written correctly
- test runner creates a test suite, where all of the tests are aggregated
- test test runner runs the fixture and creates a state with memory based on the inputs
- test runner than runs the tests individually and updates the status
- test runner outputs the status to output algos

Memory Algos:
- create neccessary memories if the test requires
- have test runners memory to hold the test status

Output Algos:
- test discover tool that collects all of the tests
- out put the test status
