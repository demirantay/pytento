algorithms and tests for the project:

### Von Neumann Architecture

Input:
User inputting tests into the framework and checking if it works correctly

Process:
The process evaluates if the tests are asserting correctly

Memory:
The process can use memory such as database access if the system has requested it

Output:
Outputting if tests run correctly or which one breaks

### Nodes

- Test Node [x]
- Test Fixture Node
- Test Suite Node
- Test Runner Node

### Algorithms

[x] Input Algos:
- user is going input their test cases

Process Algos:
- first a test runner is initiated
- first the runner checkes the tests are written in a correct format
- then it creats a test site that aggregates and understands which tests should be grouped
- after the aggregation is completed a new test fixture is created based on the requirements of the tests
- once everything is setup the runner runs the tests and updates the status based on that
- once everyhing is complete runner outputs the status to output algorithms

Memory Algos:
- create neccessary memories if the test requires
- have test runners memory to hold the test status

Output Algos:
- out put the test status
