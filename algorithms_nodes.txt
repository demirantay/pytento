algorithms and tests for the project:

### Von Neumann Architecture

Input:
User inputting tests into the framework and checking if it works correctly

Process:
The process evaluates if the tests are asserting correctly

Memory:
The process can use memory such as database access if the system has requested it

Output:
Outputting if tests run correctly or which one breaks

### Nodes

- Test Node
- Test Fixture Node
- Test Suite Node
- Test Runner Node

### Algorithms

Input Algos:
- user is going input their test cases

Process Algos:
- first take all of the test cases
- check if it requires something with memory if it does than create the setup
- create a test fixture based on the requirements of the test
- create a test suite
- start aggrageting and testing all of it unitfully
- play with memory and keep updating the test status for the tests that have
passed and failed

Memory Algos:
- create neccessary memories if the test requires
- have test runners memory to hold the test status

Output Algos:
- out put the test status
